In the last lecture I introduced one possible folder structure. It's a great structure in small and medium sized projects.

Whilst it also might work fine in bigger projects, there's also an alternative you might want to consider.

Instead of having your components in a components/ folder (and storing other shared files in other folders - e.g. shared/), you can also group your files by feature.

This could look like this:

- main.js
- users/
- - account/
- - analytics/
- shop
- - main/
- - checkout/
